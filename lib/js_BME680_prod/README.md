# js_BME680_Library wihout BSEC delivering IAQ by hermannj's iaq aquiring algoritm 

The BME680 precision sensor from Bosch SensorTec can measure humidity with ±3% accuracy, barometric pressure with ±1 hPa absolute accuracy, and temperature with ±1.0°C accuracy.

Because pressure changes with altitude, and the pressure measurements are so good, you can also use it as an altimeter with  ±1 meter or better accuracy!

The BME680 takes those sensors to the next step in that it contains a small MOX sensor. The heated metal oxide changes resistance based on the volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the air, so it can be used to detect gasses & alcohols such as Ethanol, Alcohol and Carbon Monoxide, and perform air quality measurements. 

Note it will give you one resistance value, with overall VOC content, but it cannot differentiate gasses or alcohols.

Based on herrmannj's algorithm IAQ in PPM-Units  could be delivered without using proprietary BSEC static libs.
